Hi, I'm Chris, but at some companies I go by "Beck," because there are apparently a lot of Chris's in the world 🙃

Sorry in advance that there aren't a lot of public repos with super-cool interesting projects here. I've had the opportunity to build a lot of great things, but alas, most of those are hidden behind corporate repos and orgs. Not everyone believes in open-sourcing everything, I'm afraid.

There are a fair number of student repos from my days as a Full Stack mentor with Bloc. I will be adding more now that my wife and I are building a new project; I'll open-source some of the cool integrations I build when they are ready.

In the mean-time, if you're seeing this, it's likely that I am either trying to work with your org, or I already do. In either case, let's build some cool stuff together, shall we?

Now, here's the obligatory list that GitHub suggests as a starter for this particular README. Thanks for dropping by!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Therapy industry platform with my wife, Carrie
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Digital Content Marketing
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with your org in a leadership capacity 😄
- 💬 Ask me about my book that I'm writing on building positive engineering cultures
- 📫 How to reach me: [chris@beckwebtech.com](mailto:chris@beckwebtech.com) or visit me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beckchristopher/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learned to program by reading the book on BASIC programming that came with my first computer and trying out all of the commands.

And finally, here are some notes on the contributions dashboard below:
- August 2023 to present: The first time I didn't have my dev environment set up at any org was with FanDuel. What a shame. Looking forward to coding a lot more now.
- April 2022 to November 2022: Was in a bigger leadership role at Evidation, so I didn't have the time to code as often as I had before.
- June 2020 to April 2022: At Evidation, coding as a Rails Dev or manager of the Data Integration team.
- From like October 2016 to June 2020, all of the orgs I coded for no longer exist, so I guess that those commits just vanished? So sad. Maybe I have them on a drive in my basement...
- Fairly normal Github life before then.

Hope that helps you make sense of what you're seeing. Not that I needed to provide answers and all, but it was helpful for me, anyway. 

Have a great day! ☀️
